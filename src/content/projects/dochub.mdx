## About DocHub

DocHub was born out of a moment of late-night inspiration. I was sitting in bed, frustrated after discovering—yet again—a framework that would have been perfect for a project I'd just completed. This had happened too many times: finding the ideal tool or library after I'd already built a solution without it.

The problem was clear: despite the wealth of development documentation that exists, there's no central repository that helps developers discover resources relevant to their specific needs. Each time I started a new project, I'd spend hours researching what tools to use, often missing valuable options simply because I didn't know they existed.

So I did what any developer would do—I built a solution. In a single night coding session, DocHub came to life. It's a simple but effective platform that aggregates development documentation in one searchable place, organized by categories, use cases, and compatibility.

The feature I'm most proud of is the interactive quiz that helps developers who aren't sure what they're looking for. By answering a few questions about your project requirements, tech stack preferences, and development goals, DocHub can recommend documentation resources tailored to your needs.

While I built DocHub primarily for myself, I've deployed it on Vercel so anyone can use it. It's my small contribution to making the development landscape a bit more navigable for everyone.
