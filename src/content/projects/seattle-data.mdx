## Overview

Built for Augr Inc., a Private Equity firm, this Python application automates the collection and processing of construction permit data from Seattle's Open Data API. The system enables us to work at the edge of data, identifying and acting on new construction opportunities before competitors.

## The Challenge

In the competitive landscape of private equity and real estate, being first to identify new opportunities can make the difference between securing or losing a deal. Traditional methods of monitoring building permits are:

- Manual and time-consuming
- Prone to missing opportunities
- Often delayed by days or weeks
- Difficult to scale

## The Solution

Seattle Data solves these challenges by providing:

1. **Automated Data Collection**: Fetches construction permit data every 6 hours
2. **Google Sheets Integration**: Seamless sharing of data across teams
3. **Configurable Filtering**: Customizable criteria for permit types and status
4. **Timestamp Tracking**: Detailed monitoring of all permit activities

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core application logic and API integration
- **Google Sheets API**: Data storage and team collaboration
- **Seattle Gov API**: Primary data source
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management

## Key Features

### Real-time Data Access
The application maintains a constant connection to Seattle's Open Data API, ensuring we never miss new permits as they're filed.

### Intelligent Filtering
Configurable filters allow us to focus on:
- Specific permit types
- Project values above certain thresholds
- Geographic areas of interest
- Project status and timeline

### Automated Reporting
Integration with Google Sheets provides:
- Real-time updates
- Collaborative access
- Custom formatting
- Historical tracking

## Future Extensions

The system is designed for extensibility, with planned features including:

- Email notifications for high-priority permits
- Automated outreach to permit holders
- Integration with additional data sources
- Machine learning for opportunity scoring
- Custom filtering and processing logic
